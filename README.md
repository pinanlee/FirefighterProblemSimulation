# FirefighterProblemSimulation
This is an implementation on Firefighter Problem by python programming.
# Firefighter problem:

# Function

# Future update:
1. Information table where present node information at time t simultaneously on another window
2. Calculate protected resource at the end of the simulation
3. FFâ€™s travel time and processing time update
4. Create fire class for further question settings
5. Dealing with known Issues


# Issues known:
1. When FF arrives to arbitrary node, if user don't assign next destination node, it will automatically watering (we can't choose idle).
2. When FF choose another destination node mid travel, it will instantly travel to it ignoring the previous destination and distance restrictions.
